                    <p class="top-section__intro--p">This is a movie-themed RESTful API I built that utilizes the MERN
                        stack. The project consists of
                        a list of movies in the form of cards, which has an image and description of the
                        movie, the director, genre, and actors. Not only can this app be used for reference, but users
                        are also able to create an account and add movies to their "favorite movies" list. The user also
                        has a
                        profile page where they can edit personal information and delete their account if they wish.

                    <p class="top-section__intro--p">The purpose of this project was to expose myself to the components
                        of backend web development, more specifically server side logic via Node.js as well as creating
                        and
                        maintaining a database with Mongo. Along with the backend, I also exposed myself to React, a JS
                        framework,
                        as well as Redux for managing states.

                    <p class="middle-section__journey--p">The journey began with learning about CRUD Operations and
                        their correlative HTTP methods to create
                        the endpoints, which were then tested with Postman. Once these passed I created a database with
                        PostgreSQL first for some exposure to relational databases,
                        then implemented the data into Mongo. Finally I created my models with Mongoose. <br><br>
                        Along with any other account-based website, security, authentication, and authorization are
                        paramount. I needed to create
                        a JWT token-based authentication system and authorize my endpoints, this ensures that only
                        registered users
                        can view movies and other important info, otherwise no one would need to login or even create an
                        account!
                        All of this was tested with Postman. <br> <br> The final step of the backend process was
                        creating a CORS policy, add input validation to
                        ensure users enter the correct credentials when creating an account, and hashing their
                        passwords. <br>
                        Last but not least, I launched my database via Atlas and my API with heroku before uploading it
                        to Netlify.

                        The frontend of my app began with building the client from scratch. This was accomplished
                        by installing React via Parcel, a bundler. After installation I began creating my
                        components, props, and states and then routed them with React-Router and axios. The styling on
                        this project was done via Bootstrap, and
                        finally Redux was implemented for state management.

                <p class="end__section--descr">I found this project to be very educational while at the same time a
                    great challenge. The backend was a lot more enjoyable as I ran into less problems with my code and
                    technique. The only place I struggled with was using Postman to test my endpoints. However, after
                    much trial and error, I figured out how to set up my endpoints properly and I also learned how to
                    test with Postman the right way.
                    On the frontend, I found React to be rather difficult and hard to pick up and I needed a lot of help
                    with my code, especially when routing my components. Thanks to the help of my tutor and internet
                    research, I was able to get this project done! I learned a lot about React and I am excited to
                    continue learning about it.
